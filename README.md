# APBot v2.0
This is the source code for the community and moderation bot for the AP Students Discord Server (https://discord.gg/apstudents). I am a little bit of a noob at using Git so please bear with me :^). 
The `config.json` file is an example of what the initial configuration might look like, you need to update it with your own stuff. Additionally, the environment variables `DISCORD_BOT_SECRET` (bot token) and `DATABASE_PASSWORD` (MongoDB password) are both needed for the bot to work properly.

I will update this in the near future with instructions on how to contribute to the bot.
